        <p class="introduction" style="color: #b66ee4">
          My name is Nadifa and I am in Grade 10 and I recently started at a new
          school!

          <h3>Where I Grew Up</h3>
          <p>
            I was born in Regina, Saskatchewan and lived there for a few months.
            I then moved to Toronto, Ontario and lived there until I was 9.
            Currently, I live in British Columbia, Canada and love the lakes,
            mountains and sceneries.

          <h3>Current Interests</h3>

          <p>
            Right now I enjoy running, baking, and soccer. Since it is becoming
            winter, I am looking forward to making peppermint hot chocolate,
            gingerbread cookies and more!
